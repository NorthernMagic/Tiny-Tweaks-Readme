# Welcome in!

Welcome to the Tiny Tweaks Readme! Here is all you need to know about the modpack.

If you are seeing this modpack out, I likely recommended it to you. I'm not going to hide the fact that this modpack is similar to the hundreds of other optimization modpacks. This was created for a certain community I'm in. The goal of this modpack is to improve Minecraft's performance and add in some quality of life tweaks to enhance the gameplay experience. To install using Ferium, put in ferium modpack add GB4mhgDY and then ferium modpack upgrade to install and update the pack.


# Modpack Maintenance 

There are 2 versions of Tiny Tweaks. Mainline and Legacy.

Mainline versions of Tiny Tweaks get weekly updates. Mainline versions are on the current version's, latest minor update (1.19.3) and the last major version's latest minor update (1.18.2).

Legacy versions of Tiny Tweaks get monthly updates. Legacy versions are on the latest minor update of major versions older than the 2 mainline versions (<= 1.17.1).

Regardless of status, all versions of Tiny Tweaks will get regular updates indefinitely. If no mods are updated for the pack from their developers, I will update the version number with an * to denote that. This will likely happen to legacy versions the most.

# What is Tiny Tweaks Lite?

Tiny Tweaks Lite is a lighter version of Tiny Tweaks. You get the performance mods, like Sodium and FerriteCore, without any clutter. Effectively creating an experience closer to Vanilla Minecraft. The same update schedule applies to the Lite version of Tiny Tweaks.
