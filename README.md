# Welcome in!

Welcome to the Tiny Tweaks Readme! Here is all you need to know about the modpack.


# Modpack Maintenance 

There are 2 versions of Tiny Tweaks. Mainline and Legacy.

Mainline versions of Tiny Tweaks get weekly updates. Mainline versions are on the current version's, latest minor update (1.19.3) and the last major version's latest minor update (1.18.2).

Legacy versions of Tiny Tweaks get monthly updates. Legacy versions are on the latest minor update of major versions older than the 2 mainline versions (<= 1.17.1).

Regardless of status, all versions of Tiny Tweaks will get regular updates indefinitely. If no mods are updated for the pack from their developers, I will update the version number with an * to denote that. This will likely happen to legacy versions the most.
